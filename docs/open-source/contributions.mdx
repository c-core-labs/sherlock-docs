C-CORE supports contributing to the open source community.

## Recent contributions
Below are a list of recent contributions by C-CORErs. Feel free to add!

* [C-Core-Labs](https://github.com/c-core-labs), C-CORE's open source team on GitHub, was created on May 5, 2019.

* C-Core-Labs hosted a repository for [Hacking Oil and Gas 2019](https://neia.org/hacking-oil-gas-hackathon/). The team behind the repository included two C-CORE software developers. https://github.com/c-core-labs/hog2019-web

* C-Core-Labs hosts a mirror of the source code of the European Space Agency's [sen2cor](https://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor/). Sen2cor is an open source library for processing Sentinel 1 data. While open source, the source code was previously only available in compresssed archives in support forums, which is not convenient. So, we host it here:
https://github.com/c-core-labs/sen2cor

* C-Core-Labs added two of Azavea's STAC libraries to the STAC site. Pretty small, but a nice gesture to our friends at Azavea.

* Our public notebooks repository demonstrates useful things we learn and want to share outside of C-CORE. Take a look at this notebook:
https://github.com/c-core-labs/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/download-from-aws-s3.ipynb
The parent repository is here: 
https://github.com/c-core-labs/notebooks/

* Six C-CORE members currently contribute to C-Core-Labs, and we even have one outside collaborator who worked with C-CORE developers at the oil and gas hackathon:

* Hat tip üé© to [David Gillard](https://github.com/davidtgillard) for his contributions to [SPG.NET](https://github.com/parzivail/SGP.NET), a satellite prediction library for observing satellites from ground stations: https://github.com/parzivail/SGP.NET/pull/16
