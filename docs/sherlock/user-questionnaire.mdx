## Questions

### DATA PROFILE
1. What types/sources of geospatial data do you use on most often?
2. Which raster and vector formats do you find best to work with?
3. Are there sources you would like to use but are unable to use justify in day to day use
due to issues in searching, retrieval, file formatting or excessive preprocessing required?

### DATA PORTALS
1. What is the best available data portal imagery and vector data?
2. How often are you unsure what data is needed you when you search geospatial data portals?
3. When looking for data, are there times when you have to wait for data to become available in order to proceed?
How do you reduce the impact of these wait times?
4. How often do you use the product description data from the webpage to assist in work
using downloaded data?


### API ACCESS
1. How often do you use APIs to automate data access?
2. Are there datasources you know of that have suitable data but lack of organization
 that prevent process automation
