[Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) is our new site for keeping documentation on all things related to C-CORE application development. All documentation pages are simple [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files in our `docs` git repository located [here](https://bitbucket.org/coresight709/docs/). To learn more about adding documentation, check out the [Docs Introduction](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docs) on [docusaurus.io](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
